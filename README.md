Minimalistic Flask application that lets you binge-watch your favourite show on any device with a web browser. 
Copy your legal copies of the shows you want to watch to `static` directory, run the server (works just fine on raspberry pi) and connect on your watching device (laptop/smart TV/smartphone).

Currently autoplaying next episode does not automatically activate the fullscreen mode due to permission issue.
